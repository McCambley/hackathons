# _Cryptoducks - June 5th, 2021_ ðŸ¦†

This project was initiated as a part of Practicum by Yandex's Inaugural Hackathon, which was loads of fun. The goal was to create a landing page in under two hours. An initial design for the website was presented but minute details and additions were left up to us. The function and purpose of the website was not as important as simply having fun and learning a little bit along the way. Enjoy!
